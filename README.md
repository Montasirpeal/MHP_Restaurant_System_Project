# MHP_Restaurant_System_Project
MHP_Restaurant is a simple Python project built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. It simulates a basic restaurant management system where customers, employees, and admins can interact with the system.


1. 🔎 Project Overview

The MHP_Restaurant project is designed to demonstrate the power of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
It models a restaurant system where multiple user roles (Customer, Employee, Admin) perform different operations like ordering food, managing the menu, and handling customer interactions.

This project is beginner-friendly and showcases how classes, objects, inheritance, and abstraction can be applied to solve real-life problems in software development.



2. ✨ Features

👤 User Management – Customer, Employee, and Admin classes

🍔 Menu Management – Add, update, and display food items

🛒 Order Management – Place and track orders

📦 Restaurant System – Handle different operations centrally

🧑‍💻 Fully designed with OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Abstraction)





3. 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

OOP Concepts (Class, Object, Inheritance, Abstraction, Polymorphism





4. 🔮 Future Implementations

💳 Payment System – Add support for online/offline payments

📊 Reports & Analytics – Generate daily sales and order reports

🌐 Database Integration – Store customers, orders, and menu items in a database

🖥️ GUI / Web Interface – Create a user-friendly graphical or web-based interface

📱 Mobile App Integration – Extend the project for Android/iOS apps

🔑 Login & Authentication – Secure access for Admin/Employee/Customer




5. 📝 Conclusion

The MHP_Restaurant project highlights how OOP principles can simplify the design and management of complex systems.
It provides a solid foundation for building scalable applications and can be extended with more advanced features such as database connectivity, graphical interfaces, and payment systems.

This project not only helps to strengthen OOP concepts in Python but also opens the door to developing real-world software solutions in a structured and efficient way.
